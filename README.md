## Vite starter template with Gsap and tailwindcss

this is a starter template with all configurations you need to start a project using vitejs without doing any other configuration. It includes gsap for animation and tailwindcss for styling and the cool font family Montserrat (thanks google), i've added also a smoothscroll library.

 - Clone this repo with  `git clone https://github.com/Likeur/viteTailwindGsap_template.git`
 
 - Navigate to the folder and run `npm install`

 - Now run `npm run dev` for turning on the development server 

 and there we go , hope you'll enjoy it ...
